Image classification using EfficientNetB1
EfficientNetB1 is a convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture designed for image classification tasks. It is part of the EfficientNet family of models, which are known for achieving state-of-the-art performance on various image classification benchmarks while being computationally efficient.

EfficientNetB1 is composed of several layers of convolutional and pooling operations, followed by a global average pooling layer and a fully connected layer. The convolutional layers use a novel compound scaling method to balance the depth, width, and resolution dimensions of the network, resulting in a highly efficient architecture.

One of the advantages of EfficientNetB1 is that it is pre-trained on a large-scale dataset, which allows it to extract high-level features from images and generalize well to new tasks with limited training data. It can also be fine-tuned on specific image classification tasks to further improve its accuracy.

Overall, EfficientNetB1 is a powerful and efficient CNN architecture for image classification tasks, and it has been shown to outperform many other state-of-the-art models on various benchmark datasets.
